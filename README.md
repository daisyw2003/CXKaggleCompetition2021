# CXKaggleCompetition2021
My code from my Kaggle Competition I copied over from Kaggle!
Basically we were given some data regarding strokes and were asked to create a model predicting strokes based off of other factors. 
We got to clean our data, choose the model we wanted to use, and show what we learned over the course of the semester in the club.
